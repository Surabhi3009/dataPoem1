Hyperparameter tuned Deep Neural Network

Dataset: there are 4 CSV files, the model was built over those data files
(while running the code, those 4 CSV files should be imported)


There is a ipynb file named "surabhi_DataPOEM.ipynb" 
it has all the codes, just importing and running it over any workspace like colab will do the job.
